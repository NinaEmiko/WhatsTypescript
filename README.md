# Words with Ye
Words with Ye is an interactive, web-based application where users can look up the definitions of words utilizing the DictionaryAPI.

### What sets this apart from just using Dictionary.com?

What Words with Ye aims to do is create a safe space for users where they can ask the definitions to the words they are unsure of the meaning to, whilst being comforted by the soft, warm onlooking of Kayne West.
