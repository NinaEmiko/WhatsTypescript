# Words with Ye
Words with Ye is an interactive, web-based application where users can look up the definitions of words, but utilizing the Dictionary.com API.

### What sets this apart from just using Dictionary.com?
We all find inspiration in vastly different ways. In todays world, asking questions can be intimidating for a lot of people. What Words with Kanye aims to do is create a safe space for users where they can ask the definitions to the words they are unsure of the meaning to, whilst being comforted by the soft, warm onlooking of Kayne West. 

## How was this application built?

This application was created using Typescript, Bootstrap and the Dictionary.com API.

### What is Typescript?

[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

Microsoft maintains it, it's become a very intersting contender for the best new front end language.
It's different in that it is is _strongly-typed_ but at it's code it is bascially Javascript.
